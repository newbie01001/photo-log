# photo-log
This platform lets event hosts instantly create a shared photo gallery for their events. Once registered, a host receives a unique QR code and link that guests can scan to upload pictures directly from their phones—no  signup required. The host has full control to view, approve, or delete any uploaded photos, keeping the gallery clean and curated.
